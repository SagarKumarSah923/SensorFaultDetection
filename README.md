🔍 Sensor Fault Detection
A robust system designed to identify and classify faults in sensors using machine learning, statistical analysis, or rule-based techniques to ensure data accuracy in industrial and IoT applications.

📌 Features
✅ Real-time Monitoring – Continuously scans sensor streams for anomalies.

⚠️ Fault Classification – Detects and differentiates between drift, bias, and noise.

🔔 Automated Alerts – Notifies users immediately upon detecting a fault.

📊 Data Visualization – Graphical representation of sensor data and anomalies.

🔧 Scalable Integration – Easily deployable in IoT and industrial sensor networks.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

ML Frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch (if using machine learning)

Web Framework: Flask / FastAPI (for deployment)

Database (optional): SQLite / MongoDB
