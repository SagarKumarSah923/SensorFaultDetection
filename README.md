Sensor Fault Detection

Overview

Sensor Fault Detection is a system designed to identify and diagnose faults in sensors used in various applications. The project leverages advanced techniques such as Machine Learning, Statistical Analysis, or Rule-based approaches to ensure accurate and reliable sensor readings.

Features

Real-time Monitoring: Continuously monitors sensor data for anomalies.

Fault Classification: Detects different types of sensor faults (e.g., drift, bias, noise).

Automated Alerts: Sends alerts when a fault is detected.

Data Visualization: Graphical representation of sensor behavior and detected faults.

Scalability: Can be integrated with IoT-based or industrial sensor systems.


Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (if ML is used), Matplotlib, Seaborn

Database: SQLite / MongoDB (if required for storing sensor data)

Frameworks: Flask / FastAPI (if deploying as a web service)


Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sensor-fault-detection.git
cd sensor-fault-detection


2. Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


3. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Run the application:

python main.py



Usage

Data Input: Upload or stream sensor data.

Model Training (if ML-based): Train the model on historical sensor data.

Fault Detection: The system will analyze incoming sensor data and detect faults.

Visualization: View detected anomalies via graphs and reports.


Dataset

Source: (Mention dataset source, e.g., real-time sensor logs, Kaggle, UCI ML repository)

Format: CSV / JSON / SQL
